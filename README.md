# swapiforcodethedream
This project is so fun! I am building this project as a submission criteria for the Code The Dream program into their class to further my Node.js skills.

I have a list of acceptance criteria for this project that must be met.
<br/>
1.Create the HTML for this page ✅<br/>
2.Style the elements on the page using CSS ✅<br/>
3.Retrieve the data for the page using the Star Wars API (I'm not posting their full list of criteria for this ticket item, I'm not sure if they have a privacy policy for this) ✅<br/>
4.Provide a README file that includes instructions for running the page ✅<br/>

Once I created the basic HTML, CSS, and JS files, I then began looking into the acceptance criteria for the JS portion. Specifically, what should be included in my fetch requests to show on the pages. I wanted to test to see what info the API would return, so I used Postmand to see what code is being returned for me to work with.
